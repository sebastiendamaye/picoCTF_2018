# Mr. Robots
## Question
>Do you see the same things I see? The glimpses of the flag hidden away? `http://2018shell.picoctf.com:29568` ([link](http://2018shell.picoctf.com:29568/)) 

## Hint
>What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

# Solution
A `robots.txt` file tells search engine crawlers which pages or files the crawler can or can't request from your site. This is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests. It should not be used as a way to hide parts of your website, as the file itself is public.

For this website, it seems that there is a `robots.txt` file, which discloses the following resource:
~~~~
$ curl -s http://2018shell.picoctf.com:29568/robots.txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /74efc.html
~~~~

Without surprise, the flag is there:
~~~~
$ curl -s http://2018shell.picoctf.com:29568/74efc.html | grep -o "picoCTF{.*}"
picoCTF{th3_w0rld_1s_4_danger0us_pl4c3_3lli0t_74efc}
~~~~

# Flag
`picoCTF{th3_w0rld_1s_4_danger0us_pl4c3_3lli0t_74efc}`
