# Buttons
## Question
> There is a website running at http://2018shell.picoctf.com:7949 ([link](http://2018shell.picoctf.com:7949/)). Try to see if you can push their buttons.

## Hint
>What's different about the two buttons?

# Solution
Clicking on the first button redirects to `button1.php`, but clicking on the second button (actually a hyperlink) redirects to `boo.html` while it was expected to redirect to `button2.php` according to the href link (`<a href="button2.php">Button2</a>`).

Analyzing the code for button 1 shows that the button was actually a `<input type="submit">` included in a form which method was `POST`:
`<form action="button1.php" method="POST">`.

On the other hand, the second *button* was actually a link, which submits the request via a `GET` request. There must be some controls performed on the `button2.php` page that checks the method, and redirects to `boo.html` if the method is not `POST`, something like this:

```php
<?php
if($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    echo("picoCTF{the_flag}");
} else {
    header("Location: boo.html");
}
?>
```

One way to solve this challenge is to force the request to `POST` using `curl` as follows:
~~~~
$ curl -X POST http://2018shell.picoctf.com:7949/button2.php
Well done, your flag is: picoCTF{button_button_whose_got_the_button_3e5652dd}
~~~~

# Flag
`picoCTF{button_button_whose_got_the_button_3e5652dd}`
