#Artisinal Handcrafted HTTP 3 
## Question
>We found a hidden flag server hiding behind a proxy, but the proxy has some... _interesting_ ideas of what qualifies someone to make HTTP requests. Looks like you'll have to do this one by hand. Try connecting via `nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 57775`, and use the proxy to send HTTP requests to `flag.local`. We've also recovered a username and a password for you to use on the login page: `realbusinessuser`/`potoooooooo`. 

## Hint
>_Be the browser._ When you navigate to a page, how does your browser send HTTP requests? How does this change when you submit a form?

# Solution
Port closed. Not able to do this challenge :(

# Flag
`picoCTF{FLAG_GOES_HERE}`
